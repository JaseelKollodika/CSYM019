    <h1>University of Northampton</h1> 
    <p>Come to the University of Northampton and you will see that we do things a bit differently.

        We are one of the youngest universities in the UK but we are already leading the way in adding value to society, which we call social impact. We have won multiple awards for our work in this area, among others, but what matters the most to us is ensuring that our students and graduates have the opportunity to make their mark on the world too. Thatâ€™s why we were the first university in the UK to be named as a Changemaker Campus in 2012.
        
        We want to break the mould of what Higher Education can be. This has led us to build a whole new University from the ground up that is designed to reflect the way that you actually learn rather than the way you are expected to learn. Waterside Campus opened in September 2018.
        
        Our commitment to transforming lives and inspiring change is at the heart of all that we do. We want to ensure that your experience studying with us enables you to transform your life and those of others too, no matter how great or small this may be.</p>
