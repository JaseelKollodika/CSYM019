        <p>Hello HTML</p>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. It provides a set of tags and attributes that allow developers to structure and present content on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, videos, links, and more.</p>
        <p>The structure of an HTML document consists of a series of nested elements, with each element encapsulating content or providing metadata about the content. The document is typically divided into two sections: the head and the body. The head section contains metadata such as the title of the page, keywords, and other information that is not displayed on the page. The body section contains the content of the page, including text, images, and other multimedia elements.
        </p>
        <p>HTML is the foundation of the web, and it works in conjunction with other technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive, visually appealing web pages. HTML is an open standard that is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which develops and publishes the specifications for the language.
