                An Internet application is a client-server application that uses standard Internet protocols for connecting the client to the server. You can use exactly the same techniques to create a true Internet application, which is available publicly through the World-Wide Web, or to create an intranet application. An intranet application is one which runs on your corporate intranet, and is only available to the staff in your corporation. Whenever we talk about Internet applications, we mean either true Internet applications or intranet applications. For an introduction to the World-Wide Web, see the appendix Introduction to the World-Wide Web. </p>

                    Internet applications are thin-client, thick-server. This means that the client end, the part the end-user sees and interacts with, is only responsible for the user-interface. The client runs on a Web browser - the standard tool for accessing the Internet. All the processing is done at the server end, where your corporate data is.
